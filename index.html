  <h2>Golden State Warriors History</h2>

    <p>In the early days of the NBA, the Warriors weren't always associated with the Bay Area.  The Warriors were originally based in Philadelphia and this is the era in which Wilt Chamberlain ruled the NBA and became the most dominant player of that time.  When the team moved to the Bay Area, they lost Wilt, and they began to struggle only winning 17 games out of 82 when the new season began.  They would be one of the worst teams in the NBA till 2006-2007 when they had a team nicknamed "We Believe".  The "We Believe" team consisted of players that weren't considered all stars, this team would go on to be the first Warriors team to reach the playoffs in years, and this started the recent championship run they are on now.  Before 2015, the last championship the Warriors had won was way back in 1975, then they beat the Cleveland Cavaliars in 2015 for the championship.  Kevin Durant joined the team and led them to a second championship in 2017, and then a third in 2018.</p>
